 * Nam-Nam - A traditional Ghanaian variant of Oware
 * 
 * Nam-nam: A Twi word (language spoken amongst the Akans of Ghana) meaning, 
 * "to roam" which is descriptive of the nature of play in this version of the 
 * game. This version of Oware is also played all along the West African Coast 
 * and the Caribbean. It also has many names: Jerin-Jerin (Yoruba-Nigeria), 
 * Round & Round (Antigua) etc.
 * 
 * Arrangement of board at the beginning of each game or round:
 * Four seeds are placed in each house on a board that is made up of two rows of 
 * six houses making twelve in total. 
 * 
 * Each row of six houses is the farm of the player sitting nearest to 
 * them, with two end houses used as stores for harvested seeds.
 * 
 * Object of the game:
 * The object of the game is to harvest all the opponents, farm. This 
 * ultimate aim is usually achieved after at least several rounds.
 * 
 * Starting:
 * Each player takes it in turns to start. The player must then choose a house 
 * from their own farm, from which all the seeds are scooped.
 * 
 * Sowing seeds
 * The seeds are then sown in an anticlockwise direction placing one seed in 
 * each house as one travel, around the board. If the last seed drops in a 
 * house with seeds in it, all the seeds are scooped up and then sown until 
 * ones last seed lands in a house, which is empty. 
 * 
 * If at any point in the game one player does not have any seeds, the other 
 * player must sow seeds from a house that would provide the opponent with 
 * seeds to continue playing the game. If this is not possible then the game 
 * comes to an end, with the remaining seeds going the player who has the seeds 
 * on their farm.
 * 
 * 
 * End of round
 * When there are eight seeds left in play, since it is impossible to play for 
 * the last four seeds. The player who harvests the penultimate set of four 
 * seeds, also gains the last set of four on the board, this then ends the 
 * round. The winner of the first round is the one who has harvested the most 
 * seeds.
 * 
 * Second round
 * Upon completion of the first round each player places the seeds they have 
 * won back in the houses on their farm four seeds in each house. 
 * 
 * If each is able to fill the same number of houses then it is a draw. 
 * However if one player is able to fill more houses than that which they 
 * started with then those houses filled, on the opponents side now become 
 * part of their farm in the next round. The winner of each round is the 
 * one with the most farm. This capturing of farm can go on for 
 * quite a while as lost farm can always be reclaimed in subsequent rounds.
 * 
 * End of game
 * The game ends when one persons farm (six houses) is completely harvested.
